# Time Series Analysis Projects

Welcome to my repository! I am currently taking a Time Series Analysis class at the University of Houston - Downtown. Here, I will be sharing some of my labs and assignments to showcase my analytical skills and to document my progress in this area.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in Time Series Analysis. I hope to demonstrate my capabilities and, more importantly, to engage with others who are passionate about data analytics.

## Collaboration
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities! If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to comment or reach out. Let's learn and grow together in the field of data analytics.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
